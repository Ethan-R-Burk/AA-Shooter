# AA-Shooter
*The replica of an AA Shooter game, made by follwing a tutorial. Unique artistic twist.*

## Step One ##
*The art*

An imortant part of every game for me is the creative process. What makes a game stand out and set it apart from the others? There are several ways to express creativity in a project and have it reflect the creators skills and talents. Some creators are talented with code and creative mechanics, others are talented in brainstorming concepts and art directions for a game. Each type of creativity has its place in the game making process. I decided that since I would be following the tutorial step by step, and not pushing myself too far on coding and Unity proficiency, I would focus at least a little bit of my creative direction towards the visually artistic aspect of the game. That was how I would stand out among the other people with the same codes and the same gameplay.

## Step Two ##
*The code*

Scripting most of the assets and objects in this project was quite easy. I comprehended what I was doing very easily for the most part, and only really struggled whith the video moving too quickly, causing me to rewind and play back what I missed. Other than that, the code ran smoothly. The rotator rotated, the spawner spawned nails, and the endgame script ended the game. All was well. The only roadblock in my way was the animation.

## Step Three ##
*The animations*

Animations are important tools in Unity. They allow users to create special conditions on objects and they have diverse applications. The animations I used were important for rotating the rotator at a specific speed, which undulated between fast and slow, and the animation that ended the game upon nail collision. These animations were difficult to pull off because I did not understand the UI for Unity's animation window, and the tutorial moved too quickly for me to catch important details. For instance, I didn't know that keyframes were largely unnecessary except to mark locations of change for the programmer until I discovered that I was supposed to record the changes in animation with the red record button, which took me two days and a lot of stress to finally catch.

## Step Four ##
*Review and submit*

After running the code through several times, debugging what I could, I had a product I was satisfied with. A few errors remain, but I am pleased with my work overall.
